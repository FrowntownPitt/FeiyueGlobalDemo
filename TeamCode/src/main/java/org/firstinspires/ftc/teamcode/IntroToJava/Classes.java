// This is an introduction to Java - specifically the FIRST Tech Challenge/FIRST Global Challenge
// Software Development Kit (SDK).

// This line (followed by the curly braces) defines a "block" of code.  In this case, this block is
// a "class", or a definition of what the program can do.
public class Classes {
    // the above line has 3 keywords:
    // "public" makes this class visible and usable by any other class.
    // "class" tells Java that this block is a class.
    // "Classes" is the name of this class.  Class names MUST be the same name as the file!

    // This is the "class body".  This area contains all of the code that runs under this class.
    // Methods and class members will go here.
